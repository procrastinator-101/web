                        Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī <em>(Persian: محمد بن موسی خوارزمی‎, romanized: 
                        Moḥammad ben Musā Khwārazmi; c. 780 – c. 850)</em>, Arabized as al-Khwarizmi and 
                        formerly Latinized as Algorithmi, was a Persian polymath who produced vastly

            <p>
                Ibn al-Nadīm's Kitāb al-Fihrist includes a short biography on al-Khwārizmī together 
                with a list his books. Al-Khwārizmī accomplished most of his work between <strong>813</strong> 
                and <strong>833</strong> After the Muslim conquest of Persia, Baghdad had become the centre of 
                scientific studies and trade, and many merchants and scientists from as far as China and 
                India traveled there, as did al-Khwārizmī.<br>
                He worked in the House of Wisdom established by the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma’mūn, where he 
                studied the sciences and mathematics, including the translation of <em>Greek</em> and 
                <em>Sanskrit</em> scientific manuscripts.

            <p>
                Al-Khwārizmī's contributions to mathematics, geography, astronomy, and cartography 
                established the basis for innovation in algebra and trigonometry. His systematic approach 
                to solving linear and quadratic equations led to algebra, a word derived from the title of 
                his book on the subject, <span style="color:rgb(248, 16, 178)"><strong>"The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion 
                and Balancing"</strong></span>.
                On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals written about <strong>820</strong>, was principally responsible for 
                spreading the Hindu–Arabic numeral system throughout the Middle East and Europe. It was 
                translated into Latin as Algoritmi de numero Indorum. Al-Khwārizmī, rendered as (Latin) 
                <em>Algoritmi</em>, led to the term "algorithm".<br>
                Some of his work was based on Persian and Babylonian astronomy, Indian numbers, and Greek 
                mathematics.
                Al-Khwārizmī systematized and corrected Ptolemy's data for Africa and the Middle East. 
                Another major book was Kitab surat al-ard ("The Image of the Earth"; translated as Geography), 
                presenting the coordinates of places based on those in the Geography of Ptolemy but with improved 
                values for the Mediterranean Sea, Asia, and Africa.<br>
                He also wrote on mechanical devices like the astrolabe and sundial.
                He assisted a project to determine the circumference of the Earth and in making a world 
                map for al-Ma'mun, the caliph, overseeing 70 geographers.
                When, in the 12th century, his works spread to Europe through Latin translations, it had a 
                profound impact on the advance of mathematics in Europe.
